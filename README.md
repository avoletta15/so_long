<h1 align="center">So_long</h1>

## Description :clipboard:
<p>
This project is a very small 2D game.

  Its purpose is to work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements, using <b>Minilibx</b>: a library that was developed internally at 42 School and includes basic necessary tools to make this project come to life.

External functions used: `write()`, `read()`, `open()`, `close()`, `malloc()`, `free()`, `perror`, `strerror()` & `exit()`.

For more information about <b><em>so_long's</b></em> Subject [click here](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/89621/en.subject.pdf). The library and functions were written following the rules described in the 42 [Norme](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf).

## The Game üáµüáπ
<p>
  Since I study at <b>42 School Lisboa</b>, my game was developed based in the city gems: the collectables are <b><em>Pasteis de Natas</em></b>,
  the walls are <b><em>Portuguese Tiles</em></b>, the background are <b><em>Lisbon' Sidewalks</em></b> and the exist is the famous 
  <b><em>Tram 28!</em></b>

  *** The game runs in Linux and MacOS ***
  
</p>

## How to Play üéÆ
<p>
  
  <b>Start the Game:</b> open the so_long folder in the terminal and type thhe command
  "./so_long" followed by the path to the map file finished by ".ber", as the example:
  ```
  ./so_long maps/map.ber
```
  <b>Moves:</b> |keyboard arrows| or |WASD|

  <b>Goal:</b> as a good tourist, eat all the Pasteis de Nata as you can around Lisbon's streets, so catch the
  Tram 28 to rest while you enjoy the city's beuties <em>:)</em>
  
  üó∫Ô∏è Feel free and create new map files to play as you like!
